  <h2>Mk54.io Help Guide</h2>
  <h3>Basics</h3>
  <p>Mk54.io is a multiplayer naval combat game. You start off a small ship, and consume crates to increase your score (to level up your ship). While a small amount of crates spawn naturally, sinking other ships directly increases your score and spawns many more crates.<br><br>

</p>
<h3>Movement</h3>
<p>There are 4 ways to move your ship:
  <ol>
    <li>Left click and hold outside of your ship's inner ring</li>
    <li>Right click (and optionally hold) outside your ship's inner ring (this is the recommended way to move)</li>
    <li>Tap and hold (on touch screen) outside your ship's inner ring</li>
    <li>Use the WASD or arrow keys to move, and 'x' key to stop</li>
    </ol>
Once your ship is moving in a direction, it will keep moving, to let you focus on using your weapons.
<br><br>
If using mouse controls, your ship will turn to point towards your mouse. You can control the speed of your ship by using your mouse position between the two rings as a throttle. If your mouse is outside the outer ring, your ship will increase to maximum speed.</p>
<h3>Ships</h3>
<p>Just like in real life, there are many different types of ships, each with different advantages.
  <ol>
    <li><b>Motor-torpedo boats</b> are the type of most level one ships, generally having multiple torpedoes and possibly guns.</li>
    <li><b>Mine-Countermeasures Ship</b> is a boat that can disarm mines without taking any damage.</li>
    <li><b>Oil Tankers</b> are special ships that get 2x exp from oil.</li>
    <li><b>Corvettes</b> and <b>Destroyers</b> are larger ships that carry more weapons, including slightly more powerful guns.</li>
    <li><b>Frigates</b> may carry a wide range of weapons. Are a compromise between corvettes and destroyers.</li>
    <li><b>Cruisers</b> are a compromise between destroyers and battleships.</li>
    <li><b>Battleships</b> and <b>Dreadnoughts</b> are very formidible ships, having extremely powerful main connons. They may carry a minimal amount of aircraft or torpedoes for submarien defense.</li>
    <li><b>Submarines</b> travel underwater, making them immune to certain types of weapons, but must surface to fire certain types of weapons.</li>
    <li><b>Hovercrafts</b> are very fast and can travel on both water or land.</li>
    <li><b>Rams</b> are a special type of ship that is designed to ram other ships. They take very little damage in the process, and inflict extra damage to the other ship.</li>
    <li><b>Hospital Ships</b> can heal other ships.</li>
    <li><b>Dredgers</b> have the special ability to modify land. New land can be created by clicking in front of them, and old land can de detroyed by driving over it.</li>
    <li><b>Ice Breakers</b> can plow through ice sheets without taking damage.</li>
    <li><b>Minelayers</b> can dispense long-lasting mines that can help guard a sdmall area.</li>
    <li><b>Aircraft carriers</b> command a squadron of planes to attack enemy ships! Planes will follow your mouse cursor..</li>
</ol>Once you earn enough points, you are able to upgrade your ship to the next level. The upgrade choices are shown in top-middle of the screen when an upgrade is available. Be careful when upgrading, as becoming a larger ship may lead to crashing into land or a reduction in mobility if the water is too shallow.
<br><br>
Enemies are more likely to detect larger ships. However, some modern ships have a property known as stealth to help you evade detection.
<br><br>
Here is a full list of ships: mk54.io Ships</p>

<h3>Weapons</h3>
<p>There are multiple different types of weapons available on various ships. In general, weapons are fired by clicking in the appropriate direction (although the Space key can also be used).
  <ol>
    <li><b>Torpedoes</b> are powerful underwater weapons. Some torpedoes have the ability to track targets automatically, with sonar.</li>
    <li><b>Missiles</b> are airborne and are faster, but aren't as maneuverable.</li>
    <li><b>Rockets</b> are like missiles but lack guidance.</li>
    <li><b>ICBMs</b> (Intercontinental ballistic missiles) are a type of missile that have a very powerful warhead.</li>
    <li><b>SAMs</b> (surface-to-air-missiles) can shoot down aircraft and missiles.</li>
    <li><b>Gun Turrets</b> shoot very fast shells that do moderate damage. Once fired, a shell is without guidance.</li>
    <li><b>Depth Charges</b> are stationary weapons that can be deployed against persuing ships or submarged submarines.</li>
    <li><b>ASW Mortars</b> are similar to depth charges but can be launched towards a target rather than dropped.</li>
    <li><b>Grenades</b> are similar to ASW Mortars but do less damage.</li>
    <li><b>Mines</b> are like depth charges but last much longer and are more powerful.</li>
    <li><b>Aircraft</b> fly towards your mouse cursor, and automatically deploy weapons of their own.</li>
    <li><b>Depositor</b> creates new land. We'll let you figure out if this can be used as a weapon.</li>
    </ol>
    Once fired, all weapons take some time to reload. Each type of weapon and each turret reload independently. Consuming crates speeds up reloading, while using weapons underwater slows it down.</p>
  <h3>Sensors</h3>
  <p>All ships have some combination of sensors to identify other ships and obstacles:<ol>
    <li><b>Visual</b> tracks all targets, with a range that depends on conditions</li>
    <li><b>Radar</b> tracks targets above water</li>
    <li><b>Sonar</b> tracks underwater targets</li>
    </ol>
    There are two modes for sensors, <b>active</b> and <b>passive</b>. Passive mode listens for emissions (e.g. sound in the case of sonar) from other entities. Active mode emits a signal and resolves contacts based on the signals that bounce back. In general, active mode allows you to see more, but has the potential to give away your position. You can toggle between the modes with the 'z' key.
    <br><br>
    If a contact is on the border of your sensor range, it will appear as an arrow. In this case, you know something is there, but not what it is.
  </p>
  <h3>Fleets</h3>
    <p>You can join up to five other players to form a fleet, using the panel in the top left corner of the screen. Once you have a fleet, other players can request to join it. You can then approve or deny them. Members of a fleet cannot hurt each other with weapons. Importantly, you cannot request to join a fleet until you are close enough to see one of its members, and the fleet has slots remaining.</p>
    <h3>The Arctic</h3>
    <p>Experienced players may attempt to explore the Arctic biome, located to the far north of the world. It is important to understand that Arctic has three separate types of terrain, snow, ice sheet, and cracked ice sheet. Snow, which appears white and smooth, will damage any ship upon contact. The two types of ice sheet will slow and damage most ships, the difference being that non-icebreakers cannot destroy non-cracked ice sheet. Submarines can travel beneath both types of ice sheet.</p>
